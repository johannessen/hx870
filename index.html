<h1>Standard Horizon HX870 / HX870E</h1>

<p id=githubspace>The <a href="http://www.standardhorizon.com/indexVS.cfm?cmd=DisplayProducts&amp;DivisionID=3&amp;ProdCatID=85&amp;ProdID=1791">HX870</a> is the successor to the Standard Horizon HX851 marine VHF radio. This page was inspired by a <a href=http://www.paul.sladen.org/toys/vertex/hx851e.html>collection of information about the HX851</a> by Paul Sladen. I originally created this page for my own use, then decided it might also be of use to others.

<p>I do not work for Standard Horizon / Yaesu, nor do I have first-hand “inside” knowledge about any of their products. The information on this page was gathered by playing around some with HX870 and HX870E radios and the YCE15 software that goes with it. Several radio users contributed information to this page; Norm Perron and <a href="https://github.com/cr">Christiane Rütten</a> were particularly helpful.

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Modifying the memory image directly using a hex editor is likely not a supported function of the device or its accompanying software. As such, it might <strong>void your warranty</strong> or <strong>brick the radio</strong> or even put it into a state where it transmits or receives on frequencies forbidden by international <a href=https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR/e>Radio Regulations</a>, local regulations (<a href=https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/bureau-divisions/mobility-division/maritime-mobile-service>FCC</a> / <a href=https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Sachgebiete/Telekommunikation/Unternehmen_Institutionen/Frequenzen/SpezielleAnwendungen/Seefunk/Seefunk-node.html>BNetzA</a> / …) or local law. Using the radio in such a state might disrupt vital safety-of-life services. Many jurisdictions impose a <strong>fine or criminal penalty</strong> on it. You should not mess around with any of this stuff unless you know what you’re doing! And, to finally state the obvious: Whatever <em>you</em> do, <em>I</em> cannot be held responsible for it.

<p>32kB EEPROM, stored by Standard Horizon’s YCE15 software as a *.dat file

<p>If you own <a href="https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/">010 Editor</a>, you may find the <a href="https://github.com/cr/hx870/blob/master/hx870dat.bt">binary template</a> included with the HX870 Python tools most useful. The <a href="https://github.com/cr/hx870">Python tools</a> also allow reading and writing the radio’s EEPROM on operating systems that can’t run YCE15, such as macOS.

<p>The significance of memory locations marked with a <span class="x example">yellow background</span> has not been discovered.
<br>Memory locations marked with a <span class="c example">green background</span> appear to have constant values (padding etc.) and can <em>probably</em> safely be ignored.

<p>0xff is used as a generic unused/disabled/padding value for many fields.

<p>Characters are coded as fixed-length ASCII strings (permissible chars include: <code>A-Za-z0-9 &amp;'*,-.:/[]</code>) with 0xff padding, but apparently many strings cannot be used to their full length due to UI limitations.

<p>DSC addresses presently consist of the nine-digit MMSI and a tenth digit, reserved for future use. They are coded with the full ten digits. The last digit is always zero as per <a href=https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1080>Rec. ITU-R M.1080</a>.

<p>There is a bug in the YCE15 software versions 2.0.0.4 and 2.0.1.0 that can cause corruption of the DSC individual directory (likely also other directories) when opening a memory image file containing directory entries that are not alphabetically sorted. However, the bug is only triggered when the “Individual Directory” item is chosen in YCE15. If instead the memory image is directly programmed into the device without first viewing the directory in YCE15, the result is just fine.

<p class=x>Apparently the firmware “knows” whether the radio model is a HX870 or a HX870E independent of the accessible memory content. Non-E models don’t get the region selection menu. However, it would seem logical for this to be defined in software rather than hardware. How does that work? Does perhaps the Windows firmware update software silently modify the firmware based on whether or not an E model is detected before the update (possibly using byte 0x010f)?

<p class=x>An issue seems to sometimes prevent reading values of certain fields from the radio’s memory. This affects memory locations 0x0006, 0x000b–0x000d, 0x0110–0x011f amongst many others. Instead of the true values of those fields, default or padding values appear to be returned. However, locations 0x0010–0x013 and 0x0060 are not affected. While it is not yet clear whether this is an issue with the firmware or YCE15, reading the memory using pyhx870 appears to often yield the true values.

<p class=x>The “activation per channel group” for RG and EXP doesn’t seem to work as I think it should. This ought to be solvable, as the region modes UK and SW contain RG channels that use these activation bits.

<p class=x>There is apparently some sort of bug affecting the call time and position time in the call log; the hours of the two times don’t match, but the minutes do. YCE15 says both times are supposed to be UTC. Is this an issue with calculating time zones or just a wrong label in YCE15?

<tr>        <th>Offset    <th>Data <th>Format

</table>

<p>The “channel index” is used to specify individual channels in the memory image. This is simply the position of the respective channel in the channel list of the respective channel group, starting with 1. For example, the “USA” channel group begins with channel 01A, so the number 1 would refer to that channel; number 2 would refer to the next-higher channel, which in “USA” mode is channel 03A; and so on.

<p>Note that none of the default channel lists are fully consecutive. Many have extra channels inserted (for example, Canadian channel 25B is inserted between channels 25 and 26), and for historical reasons, the international channel plan has a big gap before channel 60. Therefore the only way to determine or to resolve channel references is to get a list of all your channels (for example in YCE15 or in the radio itself) and count down from the top, starting with 1 for your first channel. An easy way to do this might be to list all your channels in a spreadsheet application.

<p>“RG” regional and “EXP” expansion channels are appended at the end of the channel list in that order (perhaps “WX” weather channels, too – not sure about these).

<!-- TODO: ready-made table of channel indices for the 8 default groups -->

<p class=x>I’m not 100 % sure the count matches my data here. The issue appears to be in the upper channels. Does channel 70 maybe not count in the index? How about other "transmission forbidden" channels? Or am I simply counting wrong after all?

<p id=preset>The status byte can be used in the preset lists to signal whether that preset is enabled. For other uses of the channel index, it is usually zero.

<p class=x>Sometimes the status byte duplicates the channel byte's value rather than being zero. Different values have also been observed. The significance of this is unclear.
<!-- In some cases, the radio itself codes e. g. EXP channel #3 as 0x1003. It has not been confirmed whether this is in fact the “correct” code, but it does seem to clash with some of the other values that have been observed here. For example, one brand-new HX870E had the values doubled for priority/sub channels in the inactive channel groups (e. g. 0x1010 for channel 16), but status zero in the active channel group (0x0010). The radio does support more than 15 EXP channels, so 0x1010 would then be ambiguous, which doesn't make sense. FWIW, the radio seems to always accept channel indices if coded as explained earlier in this section. -->

<p>There is some sort of bug in the YCE15 software version 2.0.0.4 that can result in unusable Presets. For example, when setting an “EXP” channel as a preset (possibly also when simply setting a preset to “none”), byte values in the range of 0x81–0xff are set. This results in channels with unusual numbers like “00” or “43” in the radio that give off funny noises when they’re selected.

</table>

<p>HX870E radios are usually distributed with a <a href=region-selection.jpg type=image/jpeg>leaflet</a> in the packaging explaining how to set a region. The HX870 model (non-E) is apparently hard-coded to only support Canada as a region.

<p>The region can be selected by holding down <kbd>MENU</kbd> and <kbd class=red>16/S</kbd> while turning on the HX870E. The menu described in the <a href=region-selection.jpg type=image/jpeg>leaflet</a> will then appear. Selecting a region will primarily affect channel group 3 and the regional (RG) channels, resetting channel flags and names to whatever the factory settings are for the selected region. The following group 3 regional modes are available for the HX870E:

<table>
<tr><th>Code <th>Region <th>Region (menu name) <th>Channel Group 3 Name <th>Channels in Group 3 <th>Regional Channels
<tr><td>0x00 <td>Canada <td>INTERNATIONAL <td>CAN <td>Canadian <td>—
<tr><td>0x01 <td>British Isles <td>UNITED KINGDOM <td>UK <td>international <td>M, M2
<tr><td>0x02 <td>North Sea (Belgium) <td>BELGIUM <td>BE <td>international + 31 <td>—
<tr><td>0x03 <td>North Sea (The Netherlands) <td>NETHERLAND <td>NL <td>international + 31, 37 <td>—
<tr><td>0x04 <td>Northern Europe <td>SWEDEN <td>SW <td>international <td>L1, L2, L3, F1, F2, F3
<tr><td>0x05 <td>European inland waterways <td>GERMANY <td>GRMN <td>RAINWAT <td>—
</table>

<p>Some of the region names Standard Horizon use in the menu are confusing to say the least. For example, a vessel sailing the German Baltic coast would need an international channel plan. It might seem logical to select “INTERNATIONAL” or “GERMANY” as regional mode, but neither one of those would yield an international channel plan in group 3. Instead, you would want to either use the “INTL” channel group 2, which isn’t affected by the regional mode setting at all, or “SWEDEN” mode for channel group 3, which has the benefit of enabling the Danish leisure channels.

<p>Notably, “NETHERLAND” mode provides an international channel plan even though the extra channels are mostly useful in Dutch inland waterways, where <a href=http://www.rainwat.bipt.be>RAINWAT</a> applies. This looks like a firmware bug.

<p class=x>The presumed “call type” or “priority” field is usually 0x03 for individual/group calls and 0x02 for position request/report calls. Polling and test call histories appear to either share the same memory area; it’s not yet clear whether they are differentiated by the “call type”/“priority” field, or whether there are columns in this area (left column polling, right column test).

<p class=x>It is not known why the channel is recorded in the history in addition to the log.

<p>Firmware 2.03 appears to have a bug in the “GRMN” (RAINWAT) channel group: Channel 20 doesn't have the “high power allowed” bit set although high power <em>is</em> allowed. This is easily fixable by modifying memory location 0x0955 in the memory image from 0x90 to 0xb0. (Furthermore, channels 17 and 69 are not intership channels according to RAINWAT rules, but arguably 87 is.)

<p>Firmware 2.03 also appears to set the “suffix A” bit for channel 88, but not for 87 for the USA channel group. Given that both channels were redefined at the same time for the introduction of AIS, it’s clear that either both or none should have the “A”. According to the manual, both should have the suffix, but according to <a href="https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtvhf">the Coast Guard</a>, neither should have it.

<p>Firmware 2.03 appears to have an additional bug in the “INTL” channel group (possibly others as well): Channels 15 and 17 are no longer a guard band for channel 16 as per <a href=https://www.itu.int/pub/R-REG-RR/e>ITU RR</a> (App. 18) and <a href=https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1084>Rec. M.1084</a>. Transmitting with full power is allowed on these channels unless they’re used for internal on-board communication. It would appear to make sense to at least code these as “low power default” if not “unrestricted power”.

<p>Waypoints created on the device from any source other than a DSC position report have the usual 0xff… placeholder in the MMSI field, except that the last nibble is 0x0. This looks like a firmware bug.
